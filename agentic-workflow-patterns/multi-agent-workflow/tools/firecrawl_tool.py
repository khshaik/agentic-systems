def firecrawl_tool(query: str, num_results: int = 1) -> str:
    """
    Search the web and return cleaned, markdown-formatted academic content for a given topic.

    This tool performs a semantic search using Firecrawl, retrieves the most relevant pages,
    and extracts their main textual content in markdown format along with the source title
    and URL.

    Use this tool when:
    - The question requires up-to-date, real-world, or externally sourced information
    - Additional depth, definitions, examples, applications, or recent developments are needed
    - The topic is not fully covered by core model knowledge
    - Generating detailed, exam-oriented learning material that benefits from authoritative sources

    Do NOT use this tool when:
    - The answer can be generated from standard textbook knowledge
    - The query is simple, conceptual, or does not need external enrichment

    Args:
        query: The academic topic or concept to search for.
        num_results: Number of top relevant sources to retrieve (default: 1).

    Returns:
        A single string containing:
        - Title of each source
        - Source URL
        - Extracted markdown content

        If no relevant content is found, returns:
        "No relevant sources found."
